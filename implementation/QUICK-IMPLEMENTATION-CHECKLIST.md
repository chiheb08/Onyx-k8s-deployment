## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Import Errors**
```
Error: Cannot resolve module '@/components/ui/badge'
```
**Solution**: Create the missing Badge component (File 6)

### **Issue 2: TypeScript Errors**

Error: Property 'files' does not exist on type 'SettingsSection'
```
**Solution**: Add "files" to the SettingsSection type definition

### **Issue 3: API Errors**
```
Error: 404 Not Found - /api/user/files/recent
```
**Solution**: Verify backend is running and APIs are available

### **Issue 4: Styling Issues**
```
Delete buttons not visible or poorly styled
```
**Solution**: Check Tailwind CSS classes and ensure proper opacity/color values

### **Issue 5: State Management**
```
Files not refreshing after deletion
```
**Solution**: Ensure `refreshRecentFiles()` is called after delete operations

## ðŸ“ž **Need Help?**

If you encounter any issues during implementation:

1. **Check the browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify all imports** are correct and files exist
3. **Test each phase individually** before moving to the next
4. **Compare your code** with the provided examples
5. **Check that the backend APIs** are working correctly

The implementation should take **6-10 hours total** and result in a **fully professional file management system** for Onyx! ðŸš€
