# System Improvements - User Information

## 🎉 What We Fixed

We've made two important improvements to make Onyx work better for you:

1. **Files now appear immediately** when you search for them
2. **Better error messages** when something goes wrong

---

## ✅ Improvement 1: Files Appear Immediately After Upload

### **What Was the Problem?**

Sometimes, when you uploaded a file and immediately asked a question about it, the file wouldn't show up in the search results. You had to ask the question a second time for the file to appear.

### **What We Fixed**

We improved the system so that files are ready to search right after they finish uploading. Now when you upload a file and ask a question, the file will appear in the search results on your first try.

### **What This Means for You**

- ✅ Upload a file → Ask a question → File appears immediately
- ✅ No more waiting for the second prompt
- ✅ Faster and more reliable experience

### **What to Expect**

- **Small files** (1-5 pages): Ready almost instantly
- **Medium files** (10-50 pages): Ready in 1-2 seconds
- **Large files** (50+ pages): Ready in 2-3 seconds

The system automatically adjusts the wait time based on file size, so everything works smoothly.

## ✅ Improvement 2: Better Error Messages

### **What Was the Problem?**

Sometimes you would see a confusing error message like "Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing a value" that didn't explain what went wrong or what to do about it.

### **What We Fixed**

We improved the error handling so that when something goes wrong, you'll see a clear, helpful message that explains:
- What happened
- Why it happened
- What you can do about it

### **What This Means for You**

- ✅ Clear error messages you can understand
- ✅ Helpful suggestions on what to do next
- ✅ Better experience when issues occur

### **What to Expect**

If something goes wrong, instead of seeing technical error codes, you'll see messages like:
- "The system is taking longer than expected. Please try again in a moment."
- "Your request couldn't be processed. Please check your connection and try again."

## 🚀 How to Use the Improvements

### **For File Uploads:**

1. **Upload your file** as usual
2. **Wait for the upload to complete** (you'll see a "Completed" status)
3. **Ask your question** - the file will be ready to search immediately!

**Tip:** For very large files (100+ pages), you might see a brief "Processing..." message. This is normal and the file will be ready in just a few seconds.

### **If You See an Error:**

1. **Read the error message** - it will explain what happened
2. **Try again** - most issues are temporary
3. **If the problem persists**, contact support with the error message

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Do I need to do anything different?**

**A:** No! Everything works the same way, just better. Upload files and ask questions as you normally would.

### **Q: Will this slow down file uploads?**

**A:** No. The improvements add a very small delay (less than 3 seconds) only for large files, and this ensures files are ready to use immediately. For most files, you won't notice any difference.

### **Q: What if a file still doesn't appear on the first prompt?**

**A:** This should be very rare now. If it happens:
1. Wait 2-3 seconds and try again
2. Check that the file shows "Completed" status
3. If it still doesn't work, contact support

### **Q: What if I still see confusing error messages?**

**A:** The new error messages should be much clearer. If you see something confusing:
1. Take a screenshot of the error
2. Note what you were doing when it happened
3. Contact support with this information

### **Q: Do these improvements work for all file types?**

**A:** Yes! The improvements work for all file types (PDF, Word, text files, images, etc.).
