- 🔍 **Smart Search** - Find documents by asking questions in plain English
- 💬 **AI Chat** - Ask questions about your documents and get intelligent answers
- 👥 **Team Collaboration** - Share documents and work together securely
- 🏢 **Organization Management** - Keep different teams' data separate and secure

## 🔐 **Security: How Onyx Protects Your Data**

### **1. User Authentication - "Who Are You?"**

Onyx uses multiple layers to verify who you are:

#### **Login Process:**
```
User enters email/password → Onyx checks credentials → Creates secure session → User can access their data
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- Your password is encrypted and never stored in plain text
- Onyx creates a secure "session token" (like a digital ID card)
- This token proves you're logged in without storing your password
- Sessions automatically expire for security

#### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
```
Step 1: Enter email/password
Step 2: Enter code from your phone app
Step 3: Access granted only if both are correct
```

**Why this matters:**
- Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account
- Your phone acts as a second key to your data
- Industry-standard security used by banks and major companies

### **2. Access Control - "What Can You See?"**

Onyx ensures you only see your own data:

#### **Data Separation:**
```
User A's Documents ──┐
                     ├── Complete Separation ──┐
User B's Documents ──┘                         ├── User A never sees User B's data
                                             ├── User B never sees User A's data
Company A's Data ────┐                        ├── Company A never sees Company B's data
                     └── Organization Level ──┘
Company B's Data ────┘
```

**How it works:**
- Every document is tagged with your user ID
- Database queries automatically filter by your user ID
- You physically cannot access other users' data
- Even administrators can't see your personal documents without permission

#### **Role-Based Permissions:**
```
👑 Admin: Can manage users and system settings
👨‍💼 Manager: Can see team documents and manage projects
👤 User: Can only see their own documents
```

### **3. Session Security - "How Long Can You Stay Logged In?"**

#### **Session Management:**
```
Login → Secure Session Created → Activity Tracking → Auto-Logout if Inactive
```

**Security features:**
- Sessions expire after 24 hours (configurable)
- Maximum 5 devices can be logged in simultaneously
- Suspicious activity triggers automatic logout
- "Logout from all devices" option for security

#### **Session Monitoring:**
```
Every Action → Logged with Timestamp → IP Address Tracked → Suspicious Activity Alerted
```

**What gets monitored:**
- When you log in/out
- Which documents you access
- What searches you perform
- Unusual activity patterns

## 💾 **Data Storage: Where Your Documents Live**

### **Private Storage Architecture:**
```
Your Documents → Encrypted → Stored in Your Private S3 → Only You Can Access
```

#### **File Storage Process:**
1. **Upload**: You upload a document through the web interface
2. **Encryption**: Document is encrypted using military-grade encryption (AES-256)
3. **Storage**: Encrypted document is stored in your organization's private S3 bucket
4. **Indexing**: AI reads the document and creates a searchable index
5. **Access**: Only you (and people you share with) can access the document

#### **Data Isolation:**
```
Organization A's S3 Bucket ──┐
                             ├── Complete Physical Separation
Organization B's S3 Bucket ──┘
```

**Why this matters:**
- Your documents are stored in YOUR company's storage
- Other companies' data is physically separate
- Even if there's a security breach elsewhere, your data is safe
- You control where your data lives

### **Database Security:**
```
User Data → Encrypted Fields → Database with Row-Level Security → Only Accessible by Owner
```

**What's encrypted:**
- Personal information (names, emails)
- Document content
- Search queries
- Chat messages

## 🔍 **AI Features: How Onyx Understands Your Documents**

### **Document Processing Pipeline:**
```
Upload Document → AI Reads Content → Creates Search Index → Ready for Questions
```

#### **What the AI does:**
1. **Text Extraction**: Reads text from PDFs, Word docs, etc.
2. **Understanding**: Analyzes content to understand meaning
3. **Indexing**: Creates searchable tags and categories
4. **Embeddings**: Converts text to mathematical representations for smart search

#### **Smart Search Process:**
```
You ask: "What's our vacation policy?"
↓
AI searches all your documents
↓
Finds relevant sections
↓
Provides answer with source document
```

### **AI Security:**
```
Your Question → Encrypted → AI Processing → Encrypted Response → Only You See Results
```

**Privacy guarantees:**
- AI only processes your organization's documents
- No data is sent to external AI services
- All processing happens in your secure environment
- AI responses are encrypted before being sent to you
