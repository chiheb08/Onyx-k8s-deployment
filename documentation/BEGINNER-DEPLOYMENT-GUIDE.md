# Beginner's Guide to Onyx Deployment

## 🎯 **What This Guide Is For**

This guide is written for people who are **new to deployments** and need to understand:
- What hardware to buy or rent in the cloud
- How many users Onyx can handle
- What the costs will be
- How to get started without being overwhelmed

---

## 🤔 **"I'm New to This - What Do I Need to Know?"**

### **Think of Onyx Like a Restaurant:**

#### **🍽️ The Kitchen (API Server)**
- **What it does**: Processes your documents, runs searches, handles AI
- **Like**: The kitchen in a restaurant - where all the cooking happens
- **Hardware needed**: CPU (like having enough chefs) and Memory (like having enough counter space)

#### **🍽️ The Dining Room (Web Server)**
- **What it does**: Shows the website to users, handles what they see
- **Like**: The dining room where customers sit and eat
- **Hardware needed**: Less CPU than the kitchen, but still needs some

#### **🍽️ The Host (NGINX)**
- **What it does**: Directs users to the right place, handles traffic
- **Like**: The host who seats customers and manages the flow
- **Hardware needed**: Very little - just needs to be reliable

#### **🍽️ The Storage Room (Database)**
- **What it does**: Stores all your documents, user accounts, search indexes
- **Like**: The storage room where ingredients and supplies are kept
- **Hardware needed**: Fast storage and enough space for all your data

#### **🍽️ The Prep Station (AI/ML Models)**
- **What it does**: Processes documents to make them searchable
- **Like**: The prep station where ingredients are prepared
- **Hardware needed**: Lots of CPU and Memory - this is the most demanding part

## 🚀 **Getting Started - Step by Step**

### **Step 1: Figure Out Your User Count**
```
Ask yourself:
- How many people will use Onyx?
- Will they all use it at the same time?
- How many documents will they upload per day?

Examples:
- Small company: 50-100 people, 10-20 at once
- Medium company: 200-300 people, 30-60 at once  
- Large company: 400-500 people, 50-100 at once
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Cloud Provider**
```
Think of this like choosing a restaurant location:

AWS (Amazon):
- Cheapest for small restaurants
- Good for beginners
- Lots of documentation

Google Cloud:
- Best for medium-large restaurants
- Good performance
- Slightly more expensive

Microsoft Azure:
- Good if you use Microsoft tools
- Enterprise features
- Most expensive
```

### **Step 3: Start Small**
```
Don't jump to 500 users immediately!

Start with:
- 100 users minimum requirements
- Monitor how it performs
- Scale up as needed
- Learn how everything works
```

### **Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
```
Check every week:
- Are users happy with speed?
- Are there any errors?
- Is the system stable?
- Are costs reasonable?

Adjust as needed:
- Add more resources if slow
- Remove resources if over-provisioned
- Optimize costs after 3-6 months
```

## 🔧 **Hardware Explained - In Simple Terms**

### **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
```
Think: Like the brain of a computer

What it does:
- Processes instructions
- Runs calculations
- Handles multiple tasks

For Onyx:
- More CPU = Faster document processing
- More CPU = Can handle more users
- More CPU = Better AI/ML performance

Like having more chefs in a restaurant kitchen
```

### **Memory (RAM)**
```
Think: Like the counter space in a kitchen

What it does:
- Stores data temporarily
- Keeps things ready for quick access
- Allows multiple tasks to run

For Onyx:
- More Memory = Can process larger documents
- More Memory = Faster searches
- More Memory = Better performance

Like having more counter space for food prep
```

### **Storage (Disk Space)**
```
Think: Like the pantry and storage rooms

What it does:
- Stores files permanently
- Keeps your data safe
- Allows you to store more documents

For Onyx:
- More Storage = Can store more documents
- More Storage = Can keep more search history
- More Storage = Better long-term performance

Like having bigger storage rooms for ingredients
```

### **Network (Internet Speed)**
```
Think: Like the delivery system for a restaurant

What it does:
- Transfers data between users and system
- Handles uploads and downloads
- Connects all the pieces together

For Onyx:
- More Network = Faster file uploads
- More Network = Better user experience
- More Network = Can handle more users

Like having faster delivery trucks
```

## 💡 **Tips for Beginners**

### **1. Start Small**
```
Don't try to serve 500 users on day 1!
Start with 100 users and learn how it works.
```

### **2. Monitor Everything**
```
Check your system regularly:
- Are users happy?
- Is it fast enough?
- Are there any problems?
```

### **3. Plan for Growth**
```
Design for 2x your current needs:
- If you have 100 users, plan for 200
- If you have 300 users, plan for 600
```

### **4. Budget for Learning**
```
Expect to spend 20-30% more in the first 3 months:
- Learning how to optimize
- Making adjustments
- Scaling up as needed
```

### **5. Get Help**
```
Don't try to do everything yourself:
- Use managed services when possible
- Get help from cloud provider support
- Consider hiring a consultant for setup
```

## 📞 **When to Get Help**

### **You should get help if:**
- You've never deployed anything before
- You have more than 300 users
- You need it running quickly
- You want to minimize risk
- You don't have time to learn everything

### **You can probably do it yourself if:**
- You have some technical experience
- You have less than 200 users
- You have time to learn and experiment
- You're comfortable with some risk
- You enjoy learning new things

## 🎉 **Summary**

**For beginners, here's what you need to know:**

1. **Start small** - 100 users is a good starting point
2. **Budget $750-1,000 per month** for 100 users
3. **Use AWS** - it's the cheapest and easiest to start with
4. **Plan for growth** - design for 2x your current needs
5. **Get help if needed** - don't try to do everything yourself

**Remember:** It's better to start with slightly more resources than you need rather than too few, as performance issues can frustrate users and hurt adoption.

**The most important thing:** Start small, learn how it works, and scale up as you grow!
