# How Sessions Work in Onyx - User Guide

## üéØ **Quick Answer**

**Sessions in Onyx are completely separate for each user.** Your data is isolated and secure, with multiple layers of protection ensuring that users can only access their own information.

## üìö **What Are Sessions in Onyx?**

### **Think of Sessions Like This:**

#### **1. Chat Sessions = Individual Conversations**
- **Like**: Having separate notebooks for different topics
- **Each user has their own notebooks** - you can't see other people's notebooks
- **Each conversation is private** - only you can see your chat history
- **Persistent storage** - your conversations are saved permanently

#### **2. User Sessions = Your Login State**
- **Like**: Having a key to your own house
- **Each user has their own key** - you can't use someone else's key
- **Temporary storage** - your login expires after a while for security
- **Automatic renewal** - your key gets refreshed as you use the system

#### **3. Project Sessions = Grouped Conversations**
- **Like**: Having folders for related conversations
- **Can be shared with team members** - with proper permissions
- **Organized by topic** - all related chats in one place
- **Persistent storage** - saved permanently

## üîê **How Is Data Separated Between Users?**

### **Multi-Layer Data Isolation:**

#### **1. Database Level (PostgreSQL)**
```
Every piece of data is linked to a user ID:
- Chat sessions: user_id field
- Messages: linked to chat_session ‚Üí user_id
- Files: user_id field
- Projects: user_id field
- Settings: user_id field

Result: Users can only see their own data
```

#### **2. Application Level (API)**
```
Every API request checks:
- Is the user authenticated?
- Does this data belong to the user?
- Does the user have permission?

Result: No cross-user data access possible
```

#### **3. Tenant Level (Organization)**
```
Each organization has:
- Separate database schema
- Isolated user management
- Complete data separation

Result: Organizations can't see each other's data
```

### **Real-World Example:**

#### **User A (Alice) and User B (Bob):**
```
Alice's Data:
- Chat Session 1: "Project Planning"
- Chat Session 2: "Budget Discussion"
- Files: project_doc.pdf, budget.xlsx
- Projects: "Q1 Planning", "Marketing"

Bob's Data:
- Chat Session 1: "Sales Strategy"
- Chat Session 2: "Client Meeting"
- Files: sales_pitch.pptx, client_list.csv
- Projects: "Sales Q1", "Client Relations"

Result: Alice can't see Bob's data, and vice versa
```

## üíæ **How Is Data Stored?**

### **Database Storage (PostgreSQL):**

#### **1. Chat Sessions Table:**
```sql
chat_session:
- id: unique session identifier
- user_id: links to user (Alice or Bob)
- description: "Project Planning"
- time_created: when session was created
- time_updated: last activity
```

#### **2. Messages Table:**
```sql
chat_message:
- id: unique message identifier
- chat_session_id: links to chat session
- message: "What's our budget for Q1?"
- message_type: "user" or "assistant"
- time_created: when message was sent
```

#### **3. Users Table:**
```sql
user:
- id: unique user identifier
- email: alice@company.com
- role: "admin" or "user"
- preferences: user settings
```

### **Cache Storage (Redis):**

#### **1. Authentication Sessions:**
```
Key: "auth:session:abc123"
Value: {
    "user_id": "alice-uuid",
    "tenant_id": "company-tenant",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-02T10:00:00Z"
}
TTL: 24 hours
```

#### **2. Active Sessions:**
```
Key: "session:chat-123"
Value: {
    "user_id": "alice-uuid",
    "last_accessed": "2024-01-01T15:30:00Z",
    "data": "session_state"
}
TTL: 1 hour
```

## üîÑ **How Do Sessions Work in Practice?**

### **User Login Process:**

#### **Step 1: User Enters Credentials**
```
User: Enters email and password
System: Validates credentials against database
Result: Credentials are correct
```

#### **Step 2: System Creates Session**
```
System: Creates JWT token with user ID
System: Stores session in Redis cache
System: Returns token to user's browser
Result: User is now logged in
```

#### **Step 3: User Makes Requests**
```
User: Sends request with token
System: Validates token and extracts user ID
System: Filters all data by user ID
Result: User only sees their own data
```

### **Chat Session Creation:**

#### **Step 1: User Creates New Chat**
```
User: Clicks "New Chat"
System: Creates chat_session record with user_id
System: Returns session ID to user
Result: New chat session is created
```

#### **Step 2: User Sends Message**
```
User: Types message and hits send
System: Validates user owns the session
System: Creates message record linked to session
System: Processes message with AI
Result: Message is stored and response generated
```

#### **Step 3: User Views Chat History**
```
User: Opens chat session
System: Validates user owns the session
System: Retrieves all messages for that session
System: Returns messages to user
Result: User sees their chat history
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security and Privacy**

### **Data Protection Mechanisms:**

#### **1. Authentication Security:**
```
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Secure token generation
- Automatic token refresh
- Session timeout for inactivity
```

#### **2. Authorization Security:**
```
- Every request validates user identity
- Database queries filter by user_id
- API endpoints check permissions
- No cross-user data access possible
```

#### **3. Data Encryption:**

- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- All communication uses HTTPS/TLS
- Database connections are encrypted
```

### **Privacy Guarantees:**

#### **1. Complete Data Isolation:**
```
- Users can only see their own data
