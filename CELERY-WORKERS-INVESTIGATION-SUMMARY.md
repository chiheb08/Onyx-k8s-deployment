# Celery Workers Investigation Summary

## üö® **Critical Finding: All Background Workers Were Missing**

### Investigation Requested
User reported: **"API server can't talk to model inference in production cluster"**

### Root Cause Discovered
Your Kubernetes deployment was **missing ALL 6 Celery background workers** that are critical for Onyx to function properly.

---

## üìä What Was Missing

### Comparison: Docker Compose vs Your K8s Deployment

#### Docker Compose (Working - from ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md)
```yaml
services:
  nginx: ‚úÖ Deployed
  web_server: ‚úÖ Deployed
  api_server: ‚úÖ Deployed
  inference_model_server: ‚úÖ Deployed
  indexing_model_server: ‚úÖ Deployed
  relational_db: ‚úÖ Deployed
  index (Vespa): ‚úÖ Deployed
  cache (Redis): ‚úÖ Deployed
  background:  ‚úÖ Deployed (Supervisord runs all 8 workers)
    - Beat scheduler
    - Primary worker
    - Docfetching worker
    - Docprocessing worker
    - Light worker
    - Heavy worker
    - KG processing worker
    - Monitoring worker
```

#### Your Kubernetes Deployment (Before Fix)
```yaml
Deployed:
  ‚úÖ NGINX
  ‚úÖ Web Server
  ‚úÖ API Server
  ‚úÖ Inference Model Server
  ‚úÖ Indexing Model Server
  ‚úÖ PostgreSQL
  ‚úÖ Vespa
  ‚úÖ Redis

Missing:
  ‚ùå Celery Beat (scheduler)
  ‚ùå Celery Worker - Primary
  ‚ùå Celery Worker - Docfetching
  ‚ùå Celery Worker - Docprocessing  ‚Üê THIS IS THE PROBLEM!
  ‚ùå Celery Worker - Light
  ‚ùå Celery Worker - Heavy
```

## üîç Why This Caused the "API Server Can't Talk to Model Server" Issue

### The Misunderstanding

**What you thought:**
- API server talks to both Inference and Indexing model servers
- Problem must be network/DNS/configuration

**What actually happens:**

```

‚îÇ  API SERVER                                                  ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Handles user requests                                    ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - ONLY uses Inference Model Server (for real-time queries) ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Does NOT use Indexing Model Server                       ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ  BACKGROUND WORKERS (Missing from your deployment!)         ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Process documents in background                          ‚îÇ
‚îÇ  - Call Indexing Model Server for bulk embedding           ‚îÇ

‚îÇ  - Update PostgreSQL metadata                               ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### The Real Problem

1. Your **Indexing Model Server** was deployed but **never being used**
2. The **Docprocessing Worker** (which calls the Indexing Model Server) was **completely missing**
3. Documents uploaded but never indexed (tasks queued in Redis forever)
4. Search returned no results (no vectors in Vespa)
5. System appeared to "work" but document processing was completely broken

---

## üìã Document Processing Flow

### What SHOULD Happen (With Workers)

```
1. User uploads document
        ‚Üì
2. API Server stores in MinIO
        ‚Üì
3. API Server creates Celery task in Redis
        ‚Üì
4. Docfetching Worker picks up task
        ‚Üì
5. Docfetching Worker fetches document
        ‚Üì
6. Docprocessing Worker picks up task
        ‚Üì
7. Docprocessing Worker calls INDEXING Model Server ‚Üê KEY STEP
        ‚Üì
8. Model Server returns embeddings
        ‚Üì
9. Docprocessing Worker writes to Vespa
        ‚Üì
10. Document ready for search!
```

### What ACTUALLY Happened (Without Workers)

```
1. User uploads document
        ‚Üì
2. API Server stores in MinIO
        ‚Üì
3. API Server creates Celery task in Redis
        ‚Üì
4. Task sits in Redis forever ‚ö†Ô∏è
        ‚Üì
5. No worker picks it up ‚ö†Ô∏è
        ‚Üì
6. Indexing Model Server never called ‚ö†Ô∏è
        ‚Üì
7. Document never indexed ‚ö†Ô∏è
        ‚Üì
8. Search returns nothing! ‚ùå
```

## ‚úÖ What Was Added

### 6 Celery Worker Deployments

1. **`10-celery-beat.yaml`**
   - Celery Beat scheduler
   - Schedules periodic tasks every 15s-5min
   - **Critical:** Must be exactly 1 replica

2. **`11-celery-worker-primary.yaml`**
   - Primary worker
   - Queues: `celery`, `periodic_tasks`
   - Core background tasks

3. **`12-celery-worker-light.yaml`**
   - Light worker
   - Queues: `vespa_metadata_sync`, `connector_deletion`, etc.
   - Lightweight operations

4. **`13-celery-worker-heavy.yaml`**
   - Heavy worker
   - Queues: `connector_pruning`, `connector_doc_permissions_sync`, etc.
   - Resource-intensive operations

5. **`14-celery-worker-docfetching.yaml`**
   - Docfetching worker
   - Queue: `docfetching`
   - Fetches documents from connectors

6. **`15-celery-worker-docprocessing.yaml`** ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
   - Docprocessing worker
   - Queue: `docprocessing`
   - **This worker calls the Indexing Model Server!**
   - Processes documents, generates embeddings, writes to Vespa

---

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy (All Workers)
```bash
cd /Users/chihebmhamdi/Desktop/onyx/onyx-k8s-infrastructure

# Deploy all workers
oc apply -f manifests/10-celery-beat.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/11-celery-worker-primary.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/12-celery-worker-light.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/13-celery-worker-heavy.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/14-celery-worker-docfetching.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/15-celery-worker-docprocessing.yaml

# Wait for all workers to be ready
oc get pods -l scope=onyx-backend-celery -w
```

### Minimal Deploy (Resource-Constrained)
```bash
# Deploy only critical workers
oc apply -f manifests/10-celery-beat.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/11-celery-worker-primary.yaml
oc apply -f manifests/15-celery-worker-docprocessing.yaml

# Wait for workers to be ready
oc get pods -l scope=onyx-backend-celery -w
```

---

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check All Workers Running
```bash
oc get pods -l scope=onyx-backend-celery

# Expected output:
# NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# celery-beat-xxx                              1/1     Running   0          2m
# celery-worker-primary-xxx                    1/1     Running   0          2m
# celery-worker-light-xxx                      1/1     Running   0          2m
# celery-worker-heavy-xxx                      1/1     Running   0          2m
# celery-worker-docfetching-xxx                1/1     Running   0          2m
# celery-worker-docprocessing-xxx              1/1     Running   0          2m
```

### 2. Check Docprocessing Worker Logs (Most Important)
```bash
oc logs -l app=celery-worker-docprocessing --tail=50

# Should see:
# "celery@docprocessing-xxx v5.x.x (amethyst) is starting."
# "Connected to redis://redis.onyx-infra.svc.cluster.local:6379/..."
# "[queues] .> docprocessing"
```

### 3. Check Redis Queues
```bash
# Connect to Redis
oc exec -it deploy/redis -- redis-cli

# Check queue status
LLEN docprocessing  # Should be 0 if workers are processing
LLEN celery         # Should be 0 if workers are processing

# If queues are growing, check worker logs for errors
```

### 4. Test Document Upload
```bash
# Upload a document via Onyx UI
# Then watch docprocessing worker logs

oc logs -l app=celery-worker-docprocessing --tail=100 -f

# Should see:
# "Task onyx.background.celery.tasks.indexing.upsert_documents[xxx] received"
# "Calling indexing model server at indexing-model-server.onyx-infra.svc.cluster.local:9000"
# "Received embeddings from model server"
# "Writing to Vespa..."
# "Task succeeded"
```

## üéØ Impact Assessment

### Before (Without Workers)
- ‚ùå Document indexing completely broken
- ‚ùå Connector sync broken
- ‚ùå Scheduled tasks not running
- ‚ùå Indexing Model Server deployed but never used
- ‚ùå Background processing non-functional
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API server works (but can't process documents)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UI loads (but search returns no results)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è System appears "healthy" but features are broken

### After (With Workers)
- ‚úÖ Full document processing pipeline
- ‚úÖ Automatic connector sync
- ‚úÖ Background indexing works
- ‚úÖ Periodic cleanup tasks run
- ‚úÖ Indexing Model Server used correctly
- ‚úÖ Complete system functionality
- ‚úÖ Search returns results
- ‚úÖ Document upload ‚Üí indexing ‚Üí search flow works

---

## üîß Why This Wasn't Obvious

1. **API Server starts fine** - It doesn't need workers to run
2. **UI loads normally** - Web server works independently  
3. **No obvious errors** - Tasks just queue silently in Redis
4. **Model servers respond to health checks** - They're running correctly
5. **Network/DNS appears fine** - Services can reach each other
6. **The real issue:** Workers simply didn't exist in your deployment!

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Deploy workers** in your production cluster
2. **Verify** all workers are running and connected to Redis
3. **Test** document upload and indexing flow
4. **Monitor** worker logs for any errors
5. **Check** Vespa to confirm documents are being indexed
6. **Scale** workers if needed based on load

---

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The "API server can't talk to model server" issue was actually "Background workers don't exist to talk to the Indexing Model Server."**

Your API server was working correctly‚Äîit was never supposed to talk to the Indexing Model Server directly. That's the job of the Docprocessing Worker, which was completely missing from your deployment!
